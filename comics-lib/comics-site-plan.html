      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come because it shows a broad range of activities and a brief overview of panels. People new to this kind of experience will find helpful information about best tips and different locations to visit. Most people will come because they already like the entertainment content of the site. It will be a hub of the things they enjoy and provide an appealing, easy to navigate website. Questions like “how do I avoid crowds”, “why would I want to go to this kind of event”, and “how can I plan this trip within my budget”. Answers for these questions will come in simple tips on the website that when hovered on will expand into a FAQ link. I’ll make that its own page where they can see what others like them have run into the most obstacles with and how to avoid them. The site will give people the option to plan trips and see how they would go to a comic-con, sign up for different comic-cons as they find, and see the vast array of entertainment available to them they could find. The site won’t require them to specify what they like to do and would be interested in order to give them the best options, but doing so does help if they want to customize the site more. If they want to go to comic-cons, it will then link them to the Trip Planner subpage which presents relevant, upcoming comic-cons they can look at. This subpage will show more along the lines of where these locations are, how much they cost, and what each will sort of focus on or is well known for. Trip Planner will then references other sites where people can break off to visit various comic-cons official websites to buy tickets. Other sites tend to offer just one locale or not enough helpful information for travel and cost when presenting multiple locations. This website will change that. This unique site presents the largest collection of comic-con availability and helpful information for how to navigate it. The majority of the information will be split to the different pages, from the Home page to a FAQ page and then to a Trip Planner page. This format will allow visitors to come and get whatever they most need to help them.

There the Viewers can see what obstacles others like them have run into and how to avoid them.
