        <h3>Q: How would I measure buying too many souvenirs and not splurging?</h3>
        <p2><pre>A: Souvenirs are some of the best parts of going to a comic-con. They’re basically the candy of the candy store, and you never go just to “look”. But because you’ve probably already done a lot to come to this event, it might help to try setting a personal cap on both how many things you want to get and how much you will spend. Look online at the specific site of your comic-con destination or on social media or see what you would be most interested in. From that, make a mini list of things to check out, not necessarily commit to buy, but to guide your interests. At the event, when you hit one of these you should examine if you’re ok with everything, how far into the event you are, and if there might be anything you want more and then be done. Don’t do it all on the first day! But don’t wait until the end for limited edition items, just watch how they tip the scales you’re operating on.</pre></p2>

        <h3>Q: How might COVID have affected my comic-con?</h3>
        <p2><pre>A: Depending on geographic location and local government rules, different COVID-19 protocols may be in effect. These would likely require masks throughout your participation. Wearing a mask might slightly affect any elaborate cosplaying, but beyond that your experience should remain normal. Be aware that if you feel any symptoms related to COVID-19 you should avoid the risk of exposing others and consider if you are healthy enough to attend.</pre></p2>

        <h3>Q: What might a typical trip cost compared to a more elaborate trip?</h3>
        <p2><pre>A: Single day passes can vary from around $30 up $90. Bigger and more widely known comic-cons will last several days and may use a badge or card system, which can be more expensive (looking at around $150 - $250) but allow you to do and experience more. Travel will most likely be the most expensive part of your visit depending on where you go. Adding onto however you travel there, flying adding maybe $90 - $300, you should be aware of how much you are going to alot yourself to enjoy the comic-con past all of that.</pre></p2>
